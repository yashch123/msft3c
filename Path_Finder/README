Given Problem: https://msft3c.com/preview/5

Using a given word and 2D grid of letters, find a path from the top left to the bottom right of the grid. This path must only use adjacent spaces (no diagonals) and it can't use the same space twice. After you have found the path, change all other letters in the grid to periods (.) to let the rest of your friends cross safely.
